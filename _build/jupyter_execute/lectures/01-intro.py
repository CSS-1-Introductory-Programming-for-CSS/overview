# ## What is CSS?
# 
# In a nutshell, [Computational Social Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science) focuses on **computational approaches** to **social science**.
# 
# At UCSD, [Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.ucsd.edu/) encompasses many disciplines:
# 
# - Economics.
# - Political Science.
# - Cognitive Science. 
# - Urban Studies and Planning.
# 
# And [many more](https://socialsciences.ucsd.edu/about/org-chart.html)!

# ### What is social science?
# 
# **Social Science** refers to a domain of study: social phenomena.  
# 
# - Encompasses many **scales**: human psychology, language, economic behavior, political systems.  
# - Can involve many **approaches**: qualitative interviews, statistical analysis, simulations.  

# ### What is computation?
# 
# [**Computation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) is *calculation* using well-defined steps, e.g., an *algorithm*.
# 
# - A *computer* is anything that implements these well-defined steps.  
# - Historically, the term "computer" used to refer to *people*!
# 
# A **programming language** is a way to get a computer to do these things for you.  
# 
# - Can *automate* processes: speed things up!  
# - Can perform computations at *scale*.  
# - Can *share* with others.  

# ## CSS Inspirations
# 
# - CSS often involves analysis of **large-scale datasets** using computational and statistical tools.  
# - A key part of this approach is **programming**, e.g., in Python.  
# - Can yield important theoretical and practical **insights**.  

# ### Economic mobility
# 
# Recent work by [Raj Chetty](https://rajchetty.com/) used a combination of **social network data** and **Census data** to demonstrate a link between:
# 
# - The **Economic Connectedness** of a neighborhood.  
# - How much **Upward Mobility** exists in a neighborhood.

# ### Policing and Racial Justice
# 
# Work by [Dan Jurafsky and colleagues](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1702413114#fig01) using **body-cam footage** has demonstrated racial disparities in how respectfully police officers speak to community members during routine traffic stops.

# ## Course Overview
# 
# The goal of this course is to teach you:
# 
# - **Computational thinking**: how to approach problems and devise solutions from a computational perspective.  
# - **Python programming**: how to implement those solutions in the Python programming language. 

# ### What is Python?
# 
# - Python is a **programming language**. 
#   - It's a way to "do" computation.  
# - Python is also an **ecosystem**.
#   - A particular computational approach with its own community and practices.  
# 

# ### Why Python?
# 
# - Many [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) packages for **scientific computing**.
# - Python is **widely used**.
