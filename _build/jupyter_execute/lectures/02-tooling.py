# # Tooling and Environment

# ## Goals of this lecture
# 
# In this lecture, we'll discuss some of the key **software tools** we'll be using throughout the course.
# 
# - [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).  
# - [Datahub](https://datahub.io/).  
# - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).  

# ## What is tooling, and why is it hard?  
# 
# Often, one of the hardest things about learning programming is **tooling**. 
# 
# - There are tons of new tools you've never used before, and it can seem overwhelming.  
# - So if you *do* feel overwhelmed, you're not alone!  
# 
# This means:
# 
# - Don't hesitate to ask us for help.
