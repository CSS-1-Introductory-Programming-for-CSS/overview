# Welcome to CSS 1!

CSS 1 | Sean Trott | Fall 2022 | UCSD

## Course Overview

This course will teach you how to approach research questions in social science from a **computational perspective**. This includes *thinking computationally*, as well as developing the *skillset* to implement the ideas and solutions you think of. Specifically, you will learn to program in Python.

This course is one of the [**three core courses** for the CSS Minor at UCSD](https://css.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-minor/index.html), along with CSS 2 and CSS 100. Note that there are **no official prerequisites** for this course; please see the [course expectations](course/expectations.md) page for more information.

```{note}
This course has undergone various iterations. The current version owes a big debt to [this version](https://ucsd-css-001.github.io/index.html) taught by [Professor John Serences](https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/). Although the specific labs and lectures will be new, the underlying content should be largely the same. 

Some ideas for course structure have also been adapted from [COGS 18](https://cogs18.github.io/intro.html), developed by [Professor Shannon Ellis](https://www.shanellis.com/) and [Dr. Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/).
```


## Grading

Your grade will be determined by your performance on weekly [**labs**](labs/overview.md), several [**problem sets**](problem_sets/overview.md), and a [**final project**](project/overview.md).

There are no midterms or final exams; see the [syllabus](course/syllabus.md) for more details.

## Current Iteration

The current iteration of CSS 1 is **Fall 2022**. The instructor is [Sean Trott](https://seantrott.github.io/).
