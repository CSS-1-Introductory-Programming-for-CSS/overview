# CSS 1 Schedule

Note that this schedule is **aspirational** and is therefore **subject to change**.

Also, note that for this quarter (Fall 2023), lecture is scheduled to meet only *Mondays and Fridays*. That means that we'll be focusing on a subset of the original lectures for this class; however, I've left the original lectures on the website so you can consult them as resources (if you are interested).
