# Course Expectations (and FAQ)

This course is an **introduction to programming in Python**.

Programming is a skill, like playing the guitar or salsa dancing. And importantly, **skill learning** requires lots of practice. 


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there prerequisites for this course?

No, it's open to any and all students.

Because of that, we expect that some students will have very little (or no) programming experience, while others may already be proficient in Python. The course is intended to teach Python "from the ground up", so to speak.

### Why Python?

First, Python is **widely used**, for both data analysis and software engineering.

:class: tip
In a [2021 Stack Overflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language) (N = 83K), approximately **48%** of respondents worked with or wanted to work with Python.

Second, Python also has a large, active developer community. There are many [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) packages for **scientific computing**, such as [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (for working with data tables) and [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (for plotting data). This makes Python an excellent entry-point into learning to ask scientific questions from a **computational, data-driven perspective**.

Finally, Python is **human-focused**. The goal is to write clean, readable code that can be shared with others and facilitate *communication*.


### Why no midterms or final exam?

From a pedagogical perspective, assessments are valuable for several reasons: 

1) As **motivation** for students to learn the material.  
2) As a **signal** to students and professors which material needs more practice/time.  
3) As a further possibility to **rehearse** and **construct** knowledge.

Because Python programming is a **skill**, I think that frequent labs and problem sets serve these goals much more effectively than a single midterm or final exam.
